## üìù Project Overview

This project showcases **SQL querying techniques** for real-world data analysis on a music store database. The questions range from basic queries to more complex analyses, structured into three levels:
1. **Easy**: Basic data retrieval and ordering.
2. **Moderate**: Use of joins and filtering to refine data.
3. **Advanced**: Complex aggregations, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and ranking functions.

Each question is addressed with a specific SQL query, providing actionable insights based on the data.
